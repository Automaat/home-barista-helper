## ☕ ESPRESSO (Timemore 078S)

### 🎚️ Grinder Settings

| Roast Level | Timemore 078S Setting |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Light | 0.6 - 1.4 |
| Medium | 1.5 - 2.0 |
| Dark | 2.0 - 2.6 |

> 📄 **STATED**: "For espresso, the range seems to be fairly narrow, between 0.6 to 1.4 on some units" [Source: Honest Coffee Guide]

> 📄 **STATED**: "The grinder operates across a range of 235 – 1235 microns" [Source: Honest Coffee Guide]

⚠️ **CALIBRATION NOTE**: "Many 078S units were shipped with the pin 1 to 2 holes too coarse" - calibrate zero point first!

### 📐 Brew Ratios by Roast

| Roast Level | Brew Ratio | Example (18g dose) |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Dark | 1:1.5 | 18g → 27g |
| Medium | 1:2 | 18g → 36g |
| Light | 1:2.5 - 1:4 | 18g → 45-72g |

> 📄 **STATED**: "A 1:2 ratio is recommended by professional coffee institutes as the starting point" [Source: Espresso AF]

> 📄 **STATED**: "Dark roasts are much easier to extract and allow for a lower brew ratio. For a dark roast, you can go for a 1:1.5 ratio" [Source: Various]

### ⏱️ Shot Timing

- **Target Range**: 25-35 seconds from first drip
- **Light Roasts Exception**: Can exceed 40+ seconds

> 📄 **STATED**: "Don't worry too much about going over the recommended 25-35 seconds... It's not uncommon to pull a delicious light roast that takes >40 seconds to reach target yield" [Source: Espresso AF]

### 🌡️ Temperature

- **Default**: 93.5°C
- **Light roasts**: Higher (up to 96°C)
- **Dark roasts**: Lower (90-92°C)

### 🔧 Dialing-In Protocol

```
1. LOCK DOSE → Choose based on basket (e.g., 18g)
2. SET RATIO → Start at 1:2 (18g in → 36g out)
3. ADJUST GRIND → Target 25-35s extraction
   - Too fast (<20s) → grind FINER
   - Too slow (>40s) → grind COARSER
4. TASTE & ADJUST RATIO:
   - Sour → INCREASE ratio (try 18g/40g, then 18g/44g)
   - Bitter → DECREASE ratio (try 18g/32g)
   - Bitter AND Sour → Uneven extraction, fix puck prep
5. REFINE GRIND → As fine as possible without channeling
```

> 📄 **STATED**: "Grind as fine as possible while maintaining balance... 'Too fine' causes channeling and faster flow" [Source: Espresso AF]

## ☕ ESPRESSO (Commandante C40)

> 📄 **STATED**: "Comandante is one of the few hand grinders which excel at grinding coffee for espresso" [Source: Coffeedesk]

### 🎚️ Grinder Settings

| Model | Clicks | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Standard Axle | 10-15 clicks | Coarser steps, harder to dial in |
| Red Clix | 18-24 clicks | Recommended for espresso precision |

> ⚠️ **Red Clix strongly recommended** - doubles clicks per rotation (24 vs 12), enabling finer adjustments critical for espresso

### 🔥 Espresso: Roast-Specific Parameters

| Parameter | Light Roast | Medium Roast | Dark Roast |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Grind (Standard) | 10-12 clicks | 12-14 clicks | 14-16 clicks |
| Grind (Red Clix) | 18-20 clicks | 20-22 clicks | 22-26 clicks |
| Temperature | 94-96°C | 92-94°C | 88-92°C |
| Ratio | 1:2.5 - 1:3 | 1:2 - 1:2.5 | 1:1.5 - 1:2 |
| Shot Time | 30-40s | 25-35s | 22-30s |

### 📐 Recipe Parameters

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Dose | 18g (adjust to basket) |
| Ratio | 1:2 starting point |
| Temperature | 93°C default |
| Shot Time | 25-35s |

### 🔧 Dialing-In Protocol

```
1. LOCK DOSE → 18g (or basket capacity)
2. SET RATIO → 1:2 (18g in → 36g out)
3. START GRIND → 12 clicks (Standard) / 20 clicks (Red Clix)
4. PULL SHOT → Target 25-35s
   - Too fast (<20s) → go FINER (1 click Standard / 2 clicks Red Clix)
   - Too slow (>40s) → go COARSER (1 click Standard / 2 clicks Red Clix)
5. TASTE & ADJUST RATIO:
   - Sour → INCREASE ratio (try 1:2.5)
   - Bitter → DECREASE ratio (try 1:1.8)
6. FINE-TUNE → Adjust temp if needed (lighter=hotter, darker=cooler)
```

### ⚠️ Commandante Espresso Limitations

- **Stepped adjustment** - harder to dial in precisely without Red Clix
- **~30 microns per click** - each click is a significant change for espresso
- **Consistency varies** - same coffee on different C40 units may need different settings

> 📄 **STATED**: "The same coffee brewed with the same method but two different grinders can require either 30 or 32 clicks" [Source: Coffeedesk]

## 🔥 Roast Level Adjustment Guide

### Why Roast Level Matters

> 📄 **STATED**: "Light roasts are denser and less porous, requiring finer grinding to slow down
> extraction and draw out delicate citrus, floral, and tea-like notes" [Source: QIKA Coffee]

> 📄 **STATED**: "Dark roasts are more brittle and porous, needing a slightly coarser grind to
> prevent over-extraction and bitterness" [Source: QIKA Coffee]

### The Science

| Roast Level | Bean Density | Solubility | Extraction Speed |
|-------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Light | High (dense) | Low | Slow |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Dark | Low (porous) | High | Fast |

> 📄 **STATED**: "The fundamental principle: Finer grounds create more surface area for water to
> interact with, increasing extraction efficiency" [Source: Savor Suite]

### Grind Adjustment by Roast

**When switching roasts, adjust 2-3 clicks:**

| Switching From → To | Grind Adjustment |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Dark → Light | Go FINER (2-3 clicks) |
| Light → Dark | Go COARSER (2-3 clicks) |
| Medium → Light | Go slightly FINER (1-2 clicks) |
| Medium → Dark | Go slightly COARSER (1-2 clicks) |

> 📄 **STATED**: "The difference between optimal and suboptimal grinds can be just 2-3 clicks on
> a quality grinder" [Source: Savor Suite]

### Temperature Adjustment by Roast

| Roast Level | Temperature | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Light | 94-96°C | Higher temp accelerates slow extraction |
| Medium | 92-94°C | Balanced |
| Dark | 88-92°C | Lower temp prevents over-extraction |

> 📄 **STATED**: "The normal rule is lower temperatures for darker roasts and higher temperatures
> for lighter roasts" [Source: Perfect Daily Grind]

### Espresso: Roast-Specific Parameters

| Parameter | Light Roast | Dark Roast |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Grind texture | Fine table salt | Granulated sugar |
| Extraction time | 28-35s | 22-28s |
| Brew ratio | 1:2 to 1:2.5 | 1:1.5 to 1:2 |
| Temperature | 94-96°C | 88-92°C |

> 📄 **STATED**: "Light roast beans maintain higher density and harder structure, making them
> naturally resistant to water penetration" [Source: Savor Suite]

### Your Grinders: Roast Adjustment

**Timemore 078S (Espresso)**

| Roast | Setting Range | Adjustment from Medium |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| Light | 0.6 - 1.2 | -0.4 to -0.6 finer |
| Medium | 1.2 - 1.8 | Baseline |
| Dark | 1.8 - 2.4 | +0.4 to +0.6 coarser |

**Commandante C40 (Filter)**

| Method | Light Roast | Medium | Dark Roast |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| V60 | 22-25 clicks | 25-28 clicks | 28-32 clicks |
| Chemex | 38-42 clicks | 42-45 clicks | 45-48 clicks |
| Aeropress | 18-21 clicks | 21-24 clicks | 24-28 clicks |

### Brew Time Adjustment

> 📄 **STATED**: "The lighter the roast, the longer the steep, as this allows more flavours to
> develop" [Source: Spiller & Tait]

| Roast Level | Time Adjustment |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Light | +15-30s longer |
| Medium | Baseline |
| Dark | -15-30s shorter |

### Quick Decision Matrix

```
IF switching to LIGHTER roast:
   → Grind FINER (2-3 clicks)
   → Temperature HIGHER (+2-4°C)
   → Time LONGER (+15-30s)
   → Ratio can be HIGHER (more water)

IF switching to DARKER roast:
   → Grind COARSER (2-3 clicks)
   → Temperature LOWER (-2-4°C)
   → Time SHORTER (-15-30s)
   → Ratio can be LOWER (less water)
```
